# Project---Face-Recognition

Functioning of each and every .py file:
  1. "check_cam_connected.py"  - tells the id's of the connected video capturing device (i.e. a camera index).
  2. "face_data_collect.py"    - stores the face data of the person closest to the camera.
  3. "face_recognition.py"     - recognises and tells names of the all the persons (whose data have already been stored) in the view of camera.

This project is made using KNN classifier, which is one of the most efficient and mostly used classifier in Machine Learning models.
